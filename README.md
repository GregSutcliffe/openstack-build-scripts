Scripts for building OpenStack images for various distributions that I'm
interested in.

# Debian

This was forked from
git://anonscm.debian.org/openstack/openstack-debian-images.git and all credit
goes to them. It is included here for convenience only.

# Arch

This is my attempt to create an Arch OpenStack build script using the above
debian script as inspriation.
